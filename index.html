                <h3>Rapper carrer</h3>
                <p>Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,
                 with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as turntablist and producer.
                  Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at
                   a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man.
                    Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype
                     man finally made it to the party.</p>
